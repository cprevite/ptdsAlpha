## Our project

This github repository has been created as part of the course *Programming Tools in Data Science * given by S.Orso and I.Rudnytskyi. 
This course enabled us to create the package *ptdsAlpha* containing our functions.  
The main goal of our project is to display economic and pollution indicators of European countries in the last four decades, check specific trends and correlations and implement forecasts.

## Our Shiny App

We created different functions thas we stored in our project package. 
We implemented a continuous animation of the top 10 ranking. We forecasted each variable's future values with specific time series models.
We developed animated GIFs showing the evolution through time of European indicators. We plotted comparison maps.
We then used the interactive web app creation platform [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). The Shiny App displays the output of our functions.

### Prerequisites

You should get installed the *ptdsAlpha* package in R.
You may need to download the software [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php).

## Get Started !

To visualize better how to use our app, take a look at this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/) in which we will guide you step-by-step.
